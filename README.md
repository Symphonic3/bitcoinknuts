# bitcoinknuts

A toy bitcoin node implemented in node.js

# Roadmap

- [x] Connect to peers
- [x] Download genesis block
- [ ] Automatic peer management, peerdb
- [ ] IBD of headers
- [ ] IBD of blocks
- [ ] Verify blocks (All modern BIPs except taproot)
- [ ] Pruning
- [ ] Taproot support (?)
- [ ] Build UTXO set
~~- [ ] Web UI with useful node management/stats~~
~~- [ ] Fully in-browser node using TOR Snowflake transport (I have decided that this is out of scope, node-Tor is not able to do what I wanted without heavy modification)~~
- [ ] Wallet functionality
~~- [ ] Detailed TX and script editing for the wallet, based on Symphonic3/bitcointechwiki~~
- [ ] Integration with Symphonic3/nodeBTCbot
- [ ] Mempool/tx relay (?)
